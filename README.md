# Delta-Open-Profile-Task-1
Colorization of grayscale images using Convolutional Neural Networks by Keras API.



The images are taken from the given dataset in the question.

My process consists of the following steps :

 a)Pre processing the images to give them a standard size so that there can be a universal model for all images to be processed.
 
 b)Importing libraries.
 
 c)Using the img_to_array method to convert the images into arrays.
 
 d)Changing the color balance from RGB to LAB.
 
 e)Seperating the L channel from the images and using it as input and setting the output to be a and b channel.
 
 f)Reshaping the inputs.
 
 g)Designing the model to get the desired output after evaluation and fitting.
 
 h)Getting the desired output.
